## About Me
I am a Full-stack Engineer that is always looking to grow my skills. I currently work with Talent Path and I love all of the opertunities that they provide for me. 

## Projects

#### Firearm Museum
* I created a database of firearms that would allow interested users to easily learn about any firearm that was present in the database. I had all of the Firearm objects broken down into smaller components that allowed me to give more information about each component in more detail as well as add new firearms to the database in a modular way.
  * Typescript
  * Angular/HTML/CSS
  * Postgres/JDBC
  * Springboot
  * Maven

### Find My Paradise
* As a team we created a deployed a mock AirBnB. Everyone was assigned components for the project and were tasked with making the front and backend of these components. I was in charge of the host component which gathered information from an associated listing object and populated the page with the correct information.
  * JavaScript
  * Vue/HTML/CSS
  * MySQL
  * JPA/Hibernate
  * AWS

## Experience

#### Talent Path (Full-Stack Engineer. December 2020 - present )

* Full stack engineer at Talent Path where we would be assigned to do contracting work for external companies. While not off on an assignment we would be constantly learning new skills in different languages or architecture as well as upskilling our already existing skills.
* Worked on solo projects as well as team based ones using Zoom and Git as the main forms of communication and cooperation.
